Inspiration does exist, but it must find you working.
The best way out is always through.
If there is no struggle, there is no progress.
Courage is like a muscle. We strengthen it by use.
More is lost by indecision than wrong decision.
Worry is a misuse of imagination.
If you donâ€™t risk anything, you risk even more.
The standard you walk past, is the standard you accept.
Live out of your imagination, not your history.
It is a rough road that leads to the heights of greatness.
